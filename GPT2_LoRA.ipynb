Fire produces large amounts of heat, smoke, and other particles, which can lead to warmer temperatures, increased wind speed and an overall decrease in air quality. As the air warms, it can set up a chain of conditions. For example, the warmer air can create strong air currents, which can then produce changes in pressure systems. This can cause an updraft of air, causing an increase in wind speed and a decrease in atmospheric visibility due to the haze of smoke.\\n\\nWind currents loaded with particles like smoke and ash can also produce other weather-related issues. The smoke from forest fires are made up of small, light particles, which can prevent the normal formation of rain clouds, leading to decreased rainfall in that area. A lack of rain combined with increased heat and dry conditions can lead to an overall drier climate and an increase in the risk of wildfires, creating an inescapable feedback loop.\\n\\nThe effects of large fires also extend further than weather patterns and can have a negative impact on ecosystems. Smoke released from fires can travel considerable distances, carrying with it gases and particles that can cause health issues. As temperatures rise and weather patterns change, certain ecosystems can become more prone to fires, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of wildfires which can disrupt and ultimately cause the permanent loss of certain habitats. Additionally, smoke can also alter the chemistry of soils, which can have a serious effect on the ability of plants to grow and propagate, putting their continued existence at risk.\\n\\nThe effects of large clusters of fires such as those in California can be far-reaching and can have a wide range of impacts on the environment and our health. In order to combat the effects of these fires, it is important to work on prevention and to ensure all best practices for wildfire prevention and suppression are in place. Furthermore, governments and organizations should continue to monitor and research the effects of wildfire smoke on the environment, so they can better understand the impacts and work to mitigate them in the future.\",\n          \" While you can choose between various private schools in your area, public schools are assigned by the geographic district you live in. This means you\\u2019ll probably only have one choice.\\n\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t know which public school district your home is assigned to, go to http://schooldistrictfinder.com and type in your address.;\\n, You can find comprehensive public school assessments through various free, independent resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://k12.niche.com, http://publicschoolreview.com and http://usnews.com/education/best-high-schools are a few good options.\\nYour high school\\u2019s academic ratings can have a significant impact on college acceptance., If you want to learn more about Advanced Placement, SAT/ACT preparation assistance or what kinds of classes are available, contact one of the school\\u2019s academic advisors.\\n\\n\\nYou can most likely schedule a meeting to discuss these issues in depth or simply send your questions in an email.\\n\\n, Most public schools ask upper-level students to give tours to new or prospective students.\\n\\n\\nNot only will you get to see the facilities but can ask your student guide questions about their experience there and even make a friend.\\n\\n, The average public school class in the United States has approximately 25 students while the average private school class has 15. Consider what works best for you.\\n\\n\\nThe increased attention from instructors is one of the main reasons that private schools are considered superior by many.\\nHowever, some argue that the larger class size can better prepare students for college., While public school curriculums are usually fairly similar throughout each state or school district, private school curriculums can vary drastically.For example, your new school may teach geometry in the 10th grade while you already took this subject in the 8th grade. Discuss difficulty level and subject matter with your new academic advisor and see if you can build a customized schedule to avoid going backwards or too far ahead.\\n\\n, Private schools have limited budgets and may not have the variety of extracurricular activities that a public school can offer.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, if your new school is considerably small, your old private school may actually have more clubs and organizations.\\n\\n, Private schools tend to have more rules, particularly with regard to dress code.\\n\\n\\nHowever, public schools are managed by the government which can impose unique restrictions, particularly on freedom of speech., Private and public schools will attract different kinds of teachers that may vary in quality, experience or their approach to education.\\n\\n\\nLike the rules that students are expected to follow, the rules that teachers follow can be drastically different between public and private schools. The rate of pay also typically differs. Understanding these differences can tell you more about what kinds of teachers are hired., Students often find that the attitude, culture and socioeconomic background of students are drastically different at private and public schools.\\n\\n\\nThe best way to learn more about the students at your new school is to talk to them.\\nYou can also do some research on your school district and the people that live there.\\n\\n, The biggest social difference between public and private schools is the number of other students you\\u2019ll interact with. Public schools will usually have more students in each class and enrolled at the school overall which can impact the social environment.You may notice that students at public schools come from less affluent homes. If you do come from a wealthier family, be sensitive to diverse backgrounds and don\\u2019t make assumptions about what other students can or cannot afford.\\nA larger school population might mean that you\\u2019re less likely to stand out. But it also means you\\u2019ll have more options in terms of friends and social circles.\\nIf you\\u2019re comfortable with it, try to be outgoing and start conversations so you can learn more about the student culture at your new school.\\n\\n, A great way to break the ice is to ask the people in your class if they\\u2019d like to form a study group.\\n\\n\\nNot only will you get a chance to talk to new people but this could help you adapt to differences in the schoolwork., It\\u2019s always a good idea to plan out your classes and academic goals ahead of time but it\\u2019s particularly important when you\\u2019re switching schools. The changes in curriculum, class availability and expectations will be most challenging if you\\u2019re caught off-guard and unprepared to deal with them.\\n\\n\\nMake a list of all the classes you plan to take for the remainder of your high school enrollment. The differences in class availability and curriculum are more likely to be significant as you get to elective and advanced-level courses.Think about your college preference ahead of time and research what high school classes will look best on your application.\\nWork closely with your academic advisor to ensure that there is continuity in the subjects you are studying. You don\\u2019t want to skip or repeat anything.\\n\\n, There will likely be some social differences between your new and old school but they shouldn\\u2019t be overstated. If you were able to thrive socially at your previous school, you should be ok at your new one.\\n\\n\\nOne of the most common mistakes people make when they adapt to a new social environment is trying too hard to fit in. If you present a personality or attitude that you are not comfortable with, you will either need to maintain that fa\\u00e7ade or appear inauthentic as you revert back to your natural self.t is better to be true to yourself from the outset and patiently seek the friends and social circles that are best for you.\\n\\n\",\n          \"The Bourgeois Government or the Republic Government is a term used by Karl Marx to describe the political systems in most countries in Europe in the 19th century. After the revolutions of 1848, the term was redefined by other socialist philosophers to refer to a minimum set of institutions and personnel needed to run a country effectively. The term was applied to several countries where the ruling classes converted to democracy and appointed parliaments, such as Finland in 1907, Sweden in 1909, Denmark in 1913 and Poland in 1918. The term was applied to describe the government of France in 1929, however the term was dropped after the two world wars. It was revived in 1955 by Jean-Louis Barrault in order to distinguish between the Third Republic and the Fourth Republic. Since then, the term has been used by socialists to describe any government which they consider does not fulfill the minimum requirements for a democratic government. The minimum requirements set forth by socialists are more extensive than the requirements needed to efficiently manage a country. The minimum requirements set forth by socialists are more extensive than the requirements needed to efficiently manage a country. This is the reason why these requirements have often been implemented in times of crisis, for example after World War 2. The requirements set by socialists include immunity for the upper class, necessary social services and minimum wage. The political spectrum usually splits governments into left-wing and right-wing. The left-wing governments usually set higher requirements than the right-wing governments. The left-wing governments usually establish public healthcare, subsidize education and regulate big business. The right-wing governments usually cut down taxes, leave social services to the states and regulate only big business. While the Bourgeois Government satisfies the minimum requirements for a democratic government, it fails to satisfy the more extensive requirements set by socialists.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wAP2YnJ26UXG"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load the JSONL file\n","df_val = pd.read_json(r\"/content/drive/MyDrive/subtaskA_dev_monolingual.jsonl\", lines=True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":160,"status":"ok","timestamp":1745892558240,"user":{"displayName":"Finalyearproject","userId":"09470860888582620079"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"g_L7w1b-6bsh","outputId":"47934087-4f7d-4cf8-ba51-d508fec3b01b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   text  label   model  \\\n","0     Giving gifts should always be enjoyable.

The reserve is managed by the Isiolo County Council.\\nMost operators of Kenyan safaris offer a visit to the reserve, which has several Safari Lodges and safari camps.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe Buffalo Springs National Reserve is south of the Samburu National Reserve, which lies on the other side of the Ewaso Ngiro river. It is named after an oasis of clear water at its western end.\\nThe reserve has an area of , and is at an altitude of between  and  above sea level.\\nIt is a gently rolling lowland plain of old lava flows and volcanic soils of olivine basalt. The main feature is the Champagne Ride in the southeast, an ancient lava-terrace.\\nThe climate is hot, dry and semi-arid.\\n\\nFlora\\nThere is a narrow band of riverine forest along the Ewaso Ngiro which includes Tana River Poplar, Doum Palm and magnificent specimens of Acacia elatior.\\nVegetation includes acacia tortilis woodland and large stretches of bushland dominated by Commiphora.\\nIn some areas lava rock is exposed, with scattered grass and shrubs.\\nOther parts have alkaline grasslands with occasional springs and swamps. \\nHere and there the \\\"Desert Rose\\\" (Adenium obesum) is found in the scrub, with bright pink blooms. \\nThe Salvadora persica (tooth-brush tree) shrub provides food to elephants, and its twigs are used as toothbrushes by the nomadic Samburu people.\\n\\nFauna\\nWildlife include Grant's zebra and the endangered Grevy's Zebra. Other species of mammal include reticulated giraffe, the African bush elephant, oryx, gerenuk, African buffalo, lion, leopard, cheetah and hyena. Over 365 species of bird have been recorded in the reserve. The river is home to hippopotamuses and crocodiles. Somali ostriches are widespread within the national reserve. It is larger than the Masai ostrich's and is distinctive for their indigo legs and neck.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nProtected areas of Kenya\\nGreat Rift Valley\\nProtected areas established in 1948\\nIsiolo County\",\n          \"A combination of the following (one, the other, or both, to varying degrees of limitation and/or price):\\n\\n* You own a website, online service, or mobile app; but Verizon slows it so it takes a long time to load *unless* you pay them.\\n* You subscribe to the internet as an end user. Facebook and Google load slowly, Netflix and YouTube run at standard def only, and LiveLeak and BitTorrent are totally blocked. Your ping time in games is abysmal UNLESS you pay extra for a \\\"Premium Subscriber\\\" package.\\n\\nISPs then introduce their own content services, which will of course run much faster than anyone else's over their own connections. They take all the ad revenue, and you are stuck with their service which they can do whatever they want with (including charge for it - but charge less than what they charge to use a competitor's). The original content providers slowly die off, as people don't want to pay for the \\\"Netflix\\\" package since they already pay for Netflix, or for the YouTube package since YouTube is supposed to be free.\\n\\nThey make all the money and control all the information flow. Little startup companies who can't afford to pay for all their user's bandwidth? Gone. With the competition eliminated, these companies have no reason to really innovate, and the internet becomes a crappy text-based version of cable-TV: super-high subscription fees, crap content, and no freedom to innovate.\\n\\nIt's really a shit excuse to sap as much money from people as they can, but if it happens it will cost much, much more.\\n\\nEDIT: One silver lining is that we may see more startup ISPs who DON'T pull this kind of crap - but that will be very difficult because the big boys provide all the \\\"information superhighway\\\" wires that connect the internet across long ranges, and they'll just charge the small ISPs to lease bandwidth from the big connection lines.\",\n          \"I do this a lot too. Its called 'Operant Conditioning.' Essentially, you actually end up training yourself into waking up before the alarm goes off because you know the noise that it makes will rudely wake you up. This rude awakening can be considered as **negative** reinforcement, a punishment. Initially, you will wake up to the alarm. As time goes by, however, you will just start to wake up before the alarm because subconsciously you will not want to hear the loud noises. Eventually, it will not even matter what time you set the alarm. You will end up waking a minute or two before it goes off.\\n\\n & nbsp;\\n\\nEDIT: I understand that punishment and negative reinforcement ARE different.

Fire produces large amounts of heat, smoke, and other particles, which can lead to warmer temperatures, increased wind speed and an overall decrease in air quality. As the air warms, it can set up a chain of conditions. For example, the warmer air can create strong air currents, which can then produce changes in pressure systems. This can cause an updraft of air, causing an increase in wind speed and a decrease in atmospheric visibility due to the haze of smoke.\\n\\nWind currents loaded with particles like smoke and ash can also produce other weather-related issues. The smoke from forest fires are made up of small, light particles, which can prevent the normal formation of rain clouds, leading to decreased rainfall in that area. A lack of rain combined with increased heat and dry conditions can lead to an overall drier climate and an increase in the risk of wildfires, creating an inescapable feedback loop.\\n\\nThe effects of large fires also extend further than weather patterns and can have a negative impact on ecosystems. Smoke released from fires can travel considerable distances, carrying with it gases and particles that can cause health issues. As temperatures rise and weather patterns change, certain ecosystems can become more prone to fires, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of wildfires which can disrupt and ultimately cause the permanent loss of certain habitats. Additionally, smoke can also alter the chemistry of soils, which can have a serious effect on the ability of plants to grow and propagate, putting their continued existence at risk.\\n\\nThe effects of large clusters of fires such as those in California can be far-reaching and can have a wide range of impacts on the environment and our health. In order to combat the effects of these fires, it is important to work on prevention and to ensure all best practices for wildfire prevention and suppression are in place. Furthermore, governments and organizations should continue to monitor and research the effects of wildfire smoke on the environment, so they can better understand the impacts and work to mitigate them in the future.\",\n          \" While you can choose between various private schools in your area, public schools are assigned by the geographic district you live in. This means you\\u2019ll probably only have one choice.\\n\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t know which public school district your home is assigned to, go to http://schooldistrictfinder.com and type in your address.;\\n, You can find comprehensive public school assessments through various free, independent resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://k12.niche.com, http://publicschoolreview.com and http://usnews.com/education/best-high-schools are a few good options.\\nYour high school\\u2019s academic ratings can have a significant impact on college acceptance., If you want to learn more about Advanced Placement, SAT/ACT preparation assistance or what kinds of classes are available, contact one of the school\\u2019s academic advisors.\\n\\n\\nYou can most likely schedule a meeting to discuss these issues in depth or simply send your questions in an email.\\n\\n, Most public schools ask upper-level students to give tours to new or prospective students.\\n\\n\\nNot only will you get to see the facilities but can ask your student guide questions about their experience there and even make a friend.\\n\\n, The average public school class in the United States has approximately 25 students while the average private school class has 15. Consider what works best for you.\\n\\n\\nThe increased attention from instructors is one of the main reasons that private schools are considered superior by many.\\nHowever, some argue that the larger class size can better prepare students for college., While public school curriculums are usually fairly similar throughout each state or school district, private school curriculums can vary drastically.For example, your new school may teach geometry in the 10th grade while you already took this subject in the 8th grade. Discuss difficulty level and subject matter with your new academic advisor and see if you can build a customized schedule to avoid going backwards or too far ahead.\\n\\n, Private schools have limited budgets and may not have the variety of extracurricular activities that a public school can offer.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, if your new school is considerably small, your old private school may actually have more clubs and organizations.\\n\\n, Private schools tend to have more rules, particularly with regard to dress code.\\n\\n\\nHowever, public schools are managed by the government which can impose unique restrictions, particularly on freedom of speech., Private and public schools will attract different kinds of teachers that may vary in quality, experience or their approach to education.\\n\\n\\nLike the rules that students are expected to follow, the rules that teachers follow can be drastically different between public and private schools. The rate of pay also typically differs. Understanding these differences can tell you more about what kinds of teachers are hired., Students often find that the attitude, culture and socioeconomic background of students are drastically different at private and public schools.\\n\\n\\nThe best way to learn more about the students at your new school is to talk to them.\\nYou can also do some research on your school district and the people that live there.\\n\\n, The biggest social difference between public and private schools is the number of other students you\\u2019ll interact with. Public schools will usually have more students in each class and enrolled at the school overall which can impact the social environment.You may notice that students at public schools come from less affluent homes. If you do come from a wealthier family, be sensitive to diverse backgrounds and don\\u2019t make assumptions about what other students can or cannot afford.\\nA larger school population might mean that you\\u2019re less likely to stand out. But it also means you\\u2019ll have more options in terms of friends and social circles.\\nIf you\\u2019re comfortable with it, try to be outgoing and start conversations so you can learn more about the student culture at your new school.\\n\\n, A great way to break the ice is to ask the people in your class if they\\u2019d like to form a study group.\\n\\n\\nNot only will you get a chance to talk to new people but this could help you adapt to differences in the schoolwork., It\\u2019s always a good idea to plan out your classes and academic goals ahead of time but it\\u2019s particularly important when you\\u2019re switching schools. The changes in curriculum, class availability and expectations will be most challenging if you\\u2019re caught off-guard and unprepared to deal with them.\\n\\n\\nMake a list of all the classes you plan to take for the remainder of your high school enrollment. The differences in class availability and curriculum are more likely to be significant as you get to elective and advanced-level courses.Think about your college preference ahead of time and research what high school classes will look best on your application.\\nWork closely with your academic advisor to ensure that there is continuity in the subjects you are studying. You don\\u2019t want to skip or repeat anything.\\n\\n, There will likely be some social differences between your new and old school but they shouldn\\u2019t be overstated. If you were able to thrive socially at your previous school, you should be ok at your new one.\\n\\n\\nOne of the most common mistakes people make when they adapt to a new social environment is trying too hard to fit in. If you present a personality or attitude that you are not comfortable with, you will either need to maintain that fa\\u00e7ade or appear inauthentic as you revert back to your natural self.t is better to be true to yourself from the outset and patiently seek the friends and social circles that are best for you.\\n\\n\",\n          \"The Bourgeois Government or the Republic Government is a term used by Karl Marx to describe the political systems in most countries in Europe in the 19th century. After the revolutions of 1848, the term was redefined by other socialist philosophers to refer to a minimum set of institutions and personnel needed to run a country effectively. The term was applied to several countries where the ruling classes converted to democracy and appointed parliaments, such as Finland in 1907, Sweden in 1909, Denmark in 1913 and Poland in 1918. The term was applied to describe the government of France in 1929, however the term was dropped after the two world wars. It was revived in 1955 by Jean-Louis Barrault in order to distinguish between the Third Republic and the Fourth Republic. Since then, the term has been used by socialists to describe any government which they consider does not fulfill the minimum requirements for a democratic government. The minimum requirements set forth by socialists are more extensive than the requirements needed to efficiently manage a country.

This is the reason why these requirements have often been implemented in times of crisis, for example after World War 2. The requirements set by socialists include immunity for the upper class, necessary social services and minimum wage. The political spectrum usually splits governments into left-wing and right-wing. The left-wing governments usually set higher requirements than the right-wing governments. The left-wing governments usually establish public healthcare, subsidize education and regulate big business. The right-wing governments usually cut down taxes, leave social services to the states and regulate only big business. While the Bourgeois Government satisfies the minimum requirements for a democratic government, it fails to satisfy the more extensive requirements set by socialists.\"\n        ],\n

The authors analyze four datasets and find that only a small group of words are used to express time information, and the words in time expressions demonstrate similar syntactic behaviour. To address this problem, the authors propose a type-based approach, named SynTime, to recognize time expressions.\\n\\nOne of the strengths of this paper is the authors' use of four datasets to analyze the time expressions, which provides a strong evidence to support their proposed approach. Another strength is the authors' use of three main syntactic token types and general heuristic rules to recognize time expressions, which makes the approach easy to expand.\\n\\nOne of the weaknesses of this paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed description of the datasets and the evaluation criteria used in the experiments. This makes it difficult to evaluate the results of the experiments. Additionally, the authors do not provide any comparison with other existing approaches, which could provide further evidence for the effectiveness of their proposed approach.\",\n          \",\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr/\\n\\n, Depending on your operating system, you may need to unzip the archive or it may be done for you automatically.\\n\\n,,,, If the image is aligned with the Google Earth representation, adjust the transparency slider to Opaque and you\\u2019re done! If the overlaid image is not properly aligned, you can try the next steps.\\n\\n, This is where you\\u2019ll need to enter the Latitude and Longitude coordinates that define the geographic corners of the chart to align the chart with the Google Earth representation.\\n\\n, Scroll down and locate the section entitled \\u201cBounding_coordinates\\u201d.\\n\\n, Be sure to copy each coordinate entirely, including any leading minus sign. Don\\u2019t worry that the coordinates in the HTML file are in decimal degrees format and the Google Earth fields are in Hours/Minutes/Seconds. Google Earth is smart and understands both formats.\\n\\n, If it isn\\u2019t, go back and double check that you entered each bounding coordinate correctly.\\n\\n\",\n          \" What did you do that triggered the fight? What made your friend feel so upset? If you were in your friend's shoes, how would you have reacted?\\n\\n\\nConsider telling one of your parents about what happened, and asking them for an opinion.\\nIf you're not sure why your friend is so upset, ask them. Ask in person, or send a note along the lines of \\\"I'm really sorry that I made you upset. I'm not sure exactly what I did that hurt you, but I feel bad about it and I want to make it up to you. Please let me know what I did wrong.\\\";\\n, Instead of feeling guilty and having it fermenting inside of you it's best to come clean, accept that you did wrong, and apologize. Say to your friend that you want to talk to them and do it in private. Say, \\\"I'm sorry that I (what you did wrong). I did it because (I didn't know it would hurt you/I was tired and not thinking/I was being a jerk/etc.) I am deeply sorry and I hope that you will forgive me.\\\"\\n\\n\\nIf your friend forgives you, then the two of you can move on.\\nIf not, then don't panic or get angry. The fight is putting stress on your friend too, and they need time to deal with their feelings before they can move on.\\n\\n, Try baking cookies, giving them a cake with \\\"I'm sorry\\\" written on it, buying them a CD or small thing they'd like, writing a letter, or using another creative technique.\\n\\n, The last thing that your friend wants is to have you pressuring them to forgive you, or you following them around saying sorry. Just give them some space. Wait a little, and then walk up to them and say \\\"hi\\\" or ask if the two of you can talk.\\n\\n\\nDon't wait for days or weeks for your friend to make the first move. If your friend is shy, or feels guilty about what happened, they may be afraid to make the first move. This could prolong the waiting time and you could start to drift apart.\\nOffer communication, but don't pressure them. When you enter the same room, look at them and smile or say hi, to let them know that you see them and are open to talking to them. If they are ready to talk to you, they'll take the bait.\\nIf your friend keeps ignoring your communication offers for weeks or months, that means your they have probably decided to move on. If this happens, it's best to get on with your life and make some new friends.\\n\\n, If you have done something wrong, you should be mature about it. When your friend confronts you, they have every right to do so. Instead of arguing, admit to them that you made a big mistake, it was your fault, and you're sorry. This will show that you're a mature and conscientious person who cares about them.\\n\\n\\nIf it was partially your friend's fault, hearing your apology will encourage them to think about what happened, and they might apologize too.\\n\\n, If you are being kind to them, but they keep being upset with you, this might be more than a spat between friends. Tell a parent, teacher, or counselor if...\\n\\n\\nIt seems almost impossible to please your friend\\u2014it's like they get mad at you no matter what\\nYou're constantly apologizing\\nYou often feel sad, angry at yourself, insecure, anxious, or weepy after hanging out with them\\nYour friend gets mad at you for expressing your opinions or trying to have some input on decisions. (Note: this doesn't include opinions that disrespect others' existence, such as racist or ableist remarks)\\nYou often feel nervous before hanging out with them\\nYou're particularly at risk for abuse: you've been abused in the past, you're autistic or intellectually/developmentally disabled.\\nYour friend has threatened or physically hurt you\\nThis is bullying and should not be tolerated.\\n\\n, The teacher may be able to help sort out the argument, or find a mediator who can. Remember that this wasn't easy for your friend, and that you value your friendship. Not being angry with them is a very strong and mature thing to do and if you manage it, you should be proud of yourself.\\n\\n\\nIf what you did was so bad that you'll be punished, then do your best to accept it with grace. These are the consequences of your behavior, and you can choose to learn from it.\\nIf you need to, give yourself some space from them until you're sure that you can stop being mad at them.\\n\\n, If you feel that your friendship cannot be mended, then maybe it's time to leave your friend behind. If you feel that your friendship is worth saving, and can be saved, then persevere. Either you or your friend have to make this decision, and if you feel that it's time, then it's best to sit down and talk about it then to let your friendship drift away or to have more arguments. Have a final talk and then draw a line under it.\\n\\n\\nDon't just not talk to each other ever again, just become acquaintances and go your separate ways. Maybe your friendship can be rekindled in the future.\\n\\n, You have done something wrong but it's not the end of the world. As long as you accept it, apologize sincerely, and treat your friend well, your friend should forgive you.

The reserve is managed by the Isiolo County Council.\\nMost operators of Kenyan safaris offer a visit to the reserve, which has several Safari Lodges and safari camps.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe Buffalo Springs National Reserve is south of the Samburu National Reserve, which lies on the other side of the Ewaso Ngiro river. It is named after an oasis of clear water at its western end.\\nThe reserve has an area of , and is at an altitude of between  and  above sea level.\\nIt is a gently rolling lowland plain of old lava flows and volcanic soils of olivine basalt. The main feature is the Champagne Ride in the southeast, an ancient lava-terrace.\\nThe climate is hot, dry and semi-arid.\\n\\nFlora\\nThere is a narrow band of riverine forest along the Ewaso Ngiro which includes Tana River Poplar, Doum Palm and magnificent specimens of Acacia elatior.\\nVegetation includes acacia tortilis woodland and large stretches of bushland dominated by Commiphora.\\nIn some areas lava rock is exposed, with scattered grass and shrubs.\\nOther parts have alkaline grasslands with occasional springs and swamps. \\nHere and there the \\\"Desert Rose\\\" (Adenium obesum) is found in the scrub, with bright pink blooms. \\nThe Salvadora persica (tooth-brush tree) shrub provides food to elephants, and its twigs are used as toothbrushes by the nomadic Samburu people.\\n\\nFauna\\nWildlife include Grant's zebra and the endangered Grevy's Zebra. Other species of mammal include reticulated giraffe, the African bush elephant, oryx, gerenuk, African buffalo, lion, leopard, cheetah and hyena. Over 365 species of bird have been recorded in the reserve. The river is home to hippopotamuses and crocodiles. Somali ostriches are widespread within the national reserve. It is larger than the Masai ostrich's and is distinctive for their indigo legs and neck.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nProtected areas of Kenya\\nGreat Rift Valley\\nProtected areas established in 1948\\nIsiolo County\",\n          \"A combination of the following (one, the other, or both, to varying degrees of limitation and/or price):\\n\\n* You own a website, online service, or mobile app; but Verizon slows it so it takes a long time to load *unless* you pay them.\\n* You subscribe to the internet as an end user. Facebook and Google load slowly, Netflix and YouTube run at standard def only, and LiveLeak and BitTorrent are totally blocked. Your ping time in games is abysmal UNLESS you pay extra for a \\\"Premium Subscriber\\\" package.\\n\\nISPs then introduce their own content services, which will of course run much faster than anyone else's over their own connections. They take all the ad revenue, and you are stuck with their service which they can do whatever they want with (including charge for it - but charge less than what they charge to use a competitor's). The original content providers slowly die off, as people don't want to pay for the \\\"Netflix\\\" package since they already pay for Netflix, or for the YouTube package since YouTube is supposed to be free.\\n\\nThey make all the money and control all the information flow. Little startup companies who can't afford to pay for all their user's bandwidth? Gone. With the competition eliminated, these companies have no reason to really innovate, and the internet becomes a crappy text-based version of cable-TV: super-high subscription fees, crap content, and no freedom to innovate.\\n\\nIt's really a shit excuse to sap as much money from people as they can, but if it happens it will cost much, much more.\\n\\nEDIT: One silver lining is that we may see more startup ISPs who DON'T pull this kind of crap - but that will be very difficult because the big boys provide all the \\\"information superhighway\\\" wires that connect the internet across long ranges, and they'll just charge the small ISPs to lease bandwidth from the big connection lines.\",\n          \"I do this a lot too. Its called 'Operant Conditioning.' Essentially, you actually end up training yourself into waking up before the alarm goes off because you know the noise that it makes will rudely wake you up. This rude awakening can be considered as **negative** reinforcement, a punishment. Initially, you will wake up to the alarm. As time goes by, however, you will just start to wake up before the alarm because subconsciously you will not want to hear the loud noises. Eventually, it will not even matter what time you set the alarm. You will end up waking a minute or two before it goes off.\\n\\n & nbsp;\\n\\nEDIT: I understand that punishment and negative reinforcement ARE different. However, in the scenario described, the punishment (the alarm noise) *negatively reinforces* your sleeping habits (oversleeping).  \\n\\n & nbsp;\\nPunishment - A penalty inflicted for an offense

binary system was used to denote 210 = 1000 in the original base 10 counting system from the development of the number system. This original counting system was based on fingers and toes and was used in different countries worldwide. In 1671, John Harvard, a cleric at the Massachusetts Bay Colony, established the US currency pound (apothecary weight) as weighing 16 bushel (240 pounds) : 240 ÷ 16 (lb ÷oz) = 15 (pecks) Each peck (or pottle) was 24 pecks of bread (~ 2000) Each bushel of wheat (240 pounds) was 240 ÷ 16 (lb ÷ oz) = 15 (pecks) Therefore, 15 pck = 1 bushel As such, when music was developed in base 10 in the 20th century, the BPM (beats per minute) was based on multiples of 15. In addition, the specific frequencies noted at BPM would seem to be designed for percussion instruments such as drums. If one was to develop a music notation program which perfectly divided the 21st century into 24 equal intervals (sectors) of 11 pcs, then one may see that BPM is close to multiples of
